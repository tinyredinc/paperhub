## Case Study: Solving a Real-Life Poisson–Binomial CDF Problem Using Monte Carlo Approach
**Author:** Samuel Zhang  
**Date:** 2025-08-16 

This paper studies a badminton signup problem by modeling waiting-list admission with the Poisson–Binomial CDF. Using both an exact analytical method and a high-performance Monte Carlo (HPC) implementation, it demonstrates how probabilistic modeling and scalable computation can be applied to real-world decision-making.
